Jenn would like a page For
    -Scultpure
        -description on each piece could be fun
    -Pots
    -Artist statement
        -bio
        -contact
        -resume



Entry page should have large name title and button display that says artist statement
and one big card stack that says "Works"

Clicking "works" should spread out the card stack into 3 button tiles titled 
"Sculptures"
"Pottery"
"2D"

clicking each card tile should open up a different gallery grid of images
clicking on each image opens up a modal display of the image along with description text


Need to adjust the card stack fly out to better detect when it needs to go vertical or horizontal
